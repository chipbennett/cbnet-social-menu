The concept for this Plugin is taken from <a href="http://justintadlock.com/archives/2013/08/14/social-nav-menus-part-2">example code by Justin Tadlock</a>, 
and the code used in the Plugin is derived from similar functionality in my <a href="http://wordpress.org/themes/oenology">Oenology Theme</a>.
